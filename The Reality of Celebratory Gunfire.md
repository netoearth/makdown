In California, [five fans were injured inside the Oakland Coliseum](https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/oakland-coliseum-celebratory-gunfire/2936847/) by falling bullets fired from a neighboring community. These are just a few examples of celebratory gunfire, a dangerous practice that injures and kills innocent people all over the world.

While surprisingly common at weddings and other celebrations, in the United States, celebratory gunfire becomes a significant issue during two holidays in particular - Independence Day and the New Year.

While no complete database exists, nearly 95 percent of U.S. incidents recorded by the Gun Violence Archive occurred on either July 4th, December 31st, or January 1st.

Logic dictates that indiscriminately firing a gun into the air is probably not a great idea. There's an old saying, “what goes up must come down”, and it certainly applies here. But just how dangerous can a falling bullet be? Where will it land and how fast will it be moving? How long will it take for it to reach the ground?

As it turns out, there isn't a simple answer to these questions. There are a lot of variables that affect the path of a bullet, especially when fired vertically. Gravitational forces, the size and shape of the projectile, air resistance, humidity, the firing angle, and many other factors impact trajectory, how far the bullet will go, and how much damage it can do. So, we worked with ballistics experts to find answers.

We ran simulations for five of the most common ammunition types in the U.S. at five different firing angles. The answer to the most important question became immediately and abundantly clear. Falling bullets are dangerous and can be deadly under the right circumstances. In fact, every single ammunition type from every firing angle we simulated returned to earth with enough speed to be potentially lethal. As for the rest of the questions? It’s easier if we show you.

Let’s start with the least powerful ammunition we examined - the .22 Long Rifle. The .22LR is among the most common rounds used for hunting and sport shooting.

What happens when someone fires a .22LR round at an almost completely vertical angle of 88°?

First, the bullet moves as a result of explosive acceleration - with a muzzle velocity of **1,280 feet per second.**

In just a half second, it reaches a height of **456 feet** - double that of an average 20-story building and equal to the height of the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt.

Due to gravitational forces and air resistance, the bullet’s velocity decreases as it travels upwards. After two seconds, the .22LR bullet reaches **the height of the Empire State Building (1,450 ft)**, but has slowed to a speed of **360 feet per second**.

At nine seconds, the bullet reaches its maximum height - **2,362 feet**, almost the height of the tallest building in the world, the Burj Khalifa. The velocity decreases to almost zero.

At this point, the bullet turns downwards, under the effects of gravity. On the way down, it picks up speed until the air resistance counterbalances the effect of gravity and the bullet reaches its terminal velocity.

After falling to 1,885 feet, the .22LR bullet reaches the velocity required to penetrate the skin, 148 feet per second. Even at this speed, the bullet has the potential to be deadly under the right set of circumstances.

At just under 600 feet from the ground, the bullet reaches a velocity of 200 feet per second - enough to penetrate a skull. To put that speed into perspective, that equates to just over 136 miles per hour.

Our bullet reaches the ground after 24 seconds. Even though it was fired at an almost perfectly vertical angle, the bullet lands **173 feet (53 meters) away from where it was fired - half the length of a football field.**

At 45°, a .22LR bullet would travel **2,805 feet (855 meters) horizontally - the length of eight football fields.**

Next, let’s look at the ballistic trajectories for a 9mm bullet, one of the most popular handgun rounds in the world. It has a muzzle velocity similar to that of .22LR - 1,119 feet per second, but the projectile is larger and contains more kinetic energy when fired. A 9mm round would reach a height of **2,798 feet** when fired at 88°.

The data is clear - celebratory gunfire is dangerous, no matter the ammunition type or shooting angle. According to our simulations, every round fired from every angle had lethal potential, returning with enough speed to break the skin.

All but one angle - the .22 LR at 45 degrees - were moving fast enough to penetrate a human skull.

With more powerful ammunition, bullets travel much higher in the air and return with greater speed and more kinetic energy. When fired at 88° a .30-06 bullet would reach 9,845 feet - nearly the height of mountain Fuji - and hit the ground at a speed of almost 400 feet per second - nearly 273 miles per hour.

Perhaps more unsettling is how far our simulated bullets traveled from where they were fired, even at near-vertical angles. Victims who are injured or killed by falling bullets are almost always innocent bystanders. According to our simulations, a victim could be standing thousands of feet away from the shooter and still be struck. At 88°, a .30-06 bullet could travel over 708 feet, the length of two football fields. At 80°, the distance stretches to the length of 6 football fields. Drop the shooting angle down to 45° and it could cover a distance of 11,500 feet - or the length of Central Park in New York City.

Even in rural areas, celebratory gunfire is dangerous and should be avoided. In public places and in dense, urban areas, however, it is even more so. It may also be illegal. For instance in Texas, anyone who recklessly fires a gun within the boundaries of a city with more than 100,000 residents can be jailed for up to one year and fined up to $4,000 — even if he or she fires the gun on his or her own property.

Why, then, do people still engage in this practice? The answer is likely some combination of risk blindness, ignorance, and carelessness. It may be wishful thinking, but we’d like to hope that our little animated charts help people understand the risk involved in celebratory gunfire.

##### Methodology

For our simulations, we assumed that the bullet would be fired at sea level, with no wind and a standard barometric pressure of 29.92 hg. Our calculations account for air drag and the effects of gravity.

While the return velocity is dependent upon a number of factors, firing angle is extremely important. Bullets fired at an angle maintain their angular ballistic trajectory and are less likely to tumble, allowing them to pick up more speed on the way down. It is also very difficult to aim a gun at a perfect 90 degree angle for most people - a one to two degree difference may be entirely imperceptible when firing. We chose our shooting angles for this reason, as they are angles that may reasonably be fired from in these situations.

Skin and skull penetration thresholds were sourced from [the National Library of Medicine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5912041/#:~:text=The%20bullets'%20terminal%20velocity%20required,s)%20can%20penetrate%20the%20skull.). In reality, the severity of a falling bullet injury depends on more than the speed and size of the bullet. The range of outcomes can vary greatly based on where a victim is struck, their age, and how quickly they can receive medical care. A bullet that strikes a child in the temple or eye may be fatal, while the same bullet may only moderately injure an adult who is struck in the leg.

While we believe our simulations provide an accurate representation, the speed, height, and distance of a bullet can vary greatly depending upon a number of factors. If a bullet is fired from a much higher starting altitude, the air will be thinner and provide less resistance. Inclement weather and moderate to heavy winds can create a significant variance. Additionally, the specific bullet manufacturer and type can have a significant impact on the outcome.
