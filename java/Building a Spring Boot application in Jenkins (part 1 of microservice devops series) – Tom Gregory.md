Welcome to the first of this three part series where weâ€™ll take a Spring Boot microservice from inception to deployment.

**In this article, weâ€™ll create a simple Spring Boot API application with integration tests, and then build it in a Jenkins pipeline every time a change is pushed to version control.**

The full series of articles includes:

-   **Part 1: writing a Spring Boot application and setting up a Jenkins pipeline to build it (this article)**
-   [Part 2: wrapping the application in a Docker image, building it in Jenkins, then pushing it to Docker Hub](https://tomgregory.com/building-a-spring-boot-application-in-docker-and-jenkins/)
-   [Part 3: deploying the Docker image as a container from Jenkins into AWS](https://tomgregory.com/deploying-a-spring-boot-application-into-aws-with-jenkins/)

After this series youâ€™ll have a solid foundation in the best practices to bring continuous integration to microservice architectures.

Ready? Letâ€™s get right into it!

UPDATED in June 2021 to use latest Spring, Gradle, Jenkins and other plugin/dependency versions.

Spring Boot is a framework for easily writing Java web applications. In our case, weâ€™ll use it to create an API service. This is a common requirement of microservice architectures, especially those that have a UI that communicates with a backend API.

Just for fun, weâ€™ll base the application around theme park rides. ![ðŸŽ¢](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/1f3a2.svg) It will be geared towards doing basic get & create operations on theme park rides, comprising a:

-   `GET` API at`/ride` to get all the rides the application knows about
-   `GET` API at `/ride/{id}` to get details of a specific ride by id
-   `POST` API at `/ride` to add a new ride

**Code repo:** following along with the code snippets and creating the project from scratch is the best way to get more familiar with Spring Boot. If you want a fast-pass ticket though, hereâ€™s [all the code in GitHub](https://github.com/tkgregory/spring-boot-api-example.git).

#### Application desgin

Weâ€™ll use a fairly typical Spring Boot _Model-View-Controller_ format, which normally looks like this:

![](https://www.lucidchart.com/publicSegments/view/faa413ae-6cfa-4ed2-ac23-1b32c5204f41/image.png)

In our case though, we wonâ€™t implement a service as there is no business logic to speak of.

#### Build file

Weâ€™ll be using the popular _Gradle_ tool to build this application. Make sure youâ€™ve got a [recent version](https://gradle.org/releases/) installed on your machine before proceeding.

Create a new directory for the project, and navigate into it. Run `gradle init` to start the Gradle setup wizard, choosing to create a basic Groovy project with the default name. This creates a skeleton of a Gradle project, including the Gradle wrapper used for interacting with the application.

**Gradle help:**  
1) If youâ€™re using IntelliJ IDEA check out [this article](https://tomgregory.com/5-tips-for-using-gradle-with-intellij-idea-2019/) to learn how to create Gradle projects from your IDE  
2) For a more general overview check out my introduction to Gradle [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/ojx49J1JCdQ)  
3) Hereâ€™s [an article](https://tomgregory.com/what-is-the-gradle-wrapper-and-why-should-you-use-it/) all about the infamous Gradle wrapper

A _build.gradle_ file is automatically generated. Modify it so it looks like the one below:

```
plugins {
    id 'java'
    id 'io.spring.dependency-management' version "1.0.11.RELEASE"
    id 'org.springframework.boot' version '2.5.0'
    id 'pl.allegro.tech.build.axion-release' version '1.13.2'
}

version = scmVersion.version
sourceCompatibility = 8

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    jcenter()
}

dependencies {
    implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web'
    implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-validation'
    implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-actuator'
    implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-data-jpa'
    implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-devtools'
    implementation group: 'com.h2database', name: 'h2', version: '1.4.200'

    compileOnly 'org.projectlombok:lombok:1.18.20'
    annotationProcessor 'org.projectlombok:lombok:1.18.20'

    testImplementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-test'
}

test {
    useJUnitPlatform()
}
```

-   the Spring `dependency-management` and `boot` plugins bring Spring Boot functionality to our build
-   the `axion-release` plugin adds versioning using tags
-   weâ€™re got several Spring Boot dependencies to allow us to use the Spring Boot web framework with databases
-   the `h2` dependency will enable us to use an in memory database
-   Lombok has been configured as an annotation processor to reduce boilerplate code through code generation

Now letâ€™s create some Java classes. This, and all the following classes, should be created in _src/main/java_ in the package that appears at the top of each individual class definition.

#### Entity class

The entity class represents each instance of a theme park ride. Letâ€™s create a `ThemeParkRide` clas_s_:

```
package com.tomgregory.entity;

import lombok.Getter;
import lombok.NoArgsConstructor;
import lombok.ToString;

import javax.persistence.Entity;
import javax.persistence.GeneratedValue;
import javax.persistence.GenerationType;
import javax.persistence.Id;
import javax.validation.constraints.NotEmpty;

@Entity
@Getter
@ToString
@NoArgsConstructor
public class ThemeParkRide {
  @Id
  @GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.AUTO)
  private Long id;
  @NotEmpty
  private String name;
  @NotEmpty
  private String description;
  private int thrillFactor;
  private int vomitFactor;

  public ThemeParkRide(String name, String description, int thrillFactor, int vomitFactor) {
    this.name = name;
    this.description = description;
    this.thrillFactor = thrillFactor;
    this.vomitFactor = vomitFactor;
  }

}
```

-   this is a simple POJO (plain old Java object) class with `id`, `name`, `description`, `thrillFactor`, and `vomitFactor` fields ![ðŸ¤®](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/1f92e.svg)
-   the class is annotated with `@Entity` so Spring Boot knows what kind of class it is
-   weâ€™re using the Lombok annotation processor to generate a default constructor, a `toString()` method, and getter methods for each field
-   `@NotEmpty` annotations are applied to the _name_ and _description_ fields for validation when we create a theme park ride

![](https://tomgregory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Theme_Park-580x326-1.png)

Does anyone remember this game from the 1990s?

#### Repository class

Weâ€™ll use a repository interface to read and write `ThemeParkRide` entities from/to the database. The beauty of the _spring-boot-starter-data-jpa_ library that we imported in _build.gradle_ is that you only have to define the method signatures of the interactions you want with the database, and the library does the rest.

Create an interface called `ThemeParkRideRepository`:

```
package com.tomgregory.repository;

import com.tomgregory.entity.ThemeParkRide;
import org.springframework.data.repository.CrudRepository;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Repository;

import java.util.List;

@Repository
public interface ThemeParkRideRepository extends CrudRepository<ThemeParkRide, Long> {
    List<ThemeParkRide> findByName(String name);
}

```

-   the `@Repository` annotation lets Spring Boot know what kind of component this class is
-   extending `CrudRepository` provides some default methods such as `save` and `findById`
-   the `findByName` method definition will be implemented automatically by Spring Boot, matching to the `name` field of the `ThemeParkRide` entity class

#### Controller class

A controller class defines an API and how it interacts with the rest of the application. Create a class called `ThemeParkRideController`:

```
package com.tomgregory.controller;

import com.tomgregory.repository.ThemeParkRideRepository;
import com.tomgregory.entity.ThemeParkRide;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;
import org.springframework.http.HttpStatus;
import org.springframework.http.MediaType;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;
import org.springframework.web.server.ResponseStatusException;

import javax.validation.Valid;

@RestController
public class ThemeParkRideController {
    private final ThemeParkRideRepository themeParkRideRepository;

    public ThemeParkRideController(ThemeParkRideRepository themeParkRideRepository) {
        this.themeParkRideRepository = themeParkRideRepository;
    }

    @GetMapping(value = "/ride", produces = MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE)
    public Iterable<ThemeParkRide> getRides() {
        return themeParkRideRepository.findAll();
    }

    @GetMapping(value = "/ride/{id}", produces = MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE)
    public ThemeParkRide getRide(@PathVariable long id){
        return themeParkRideRepository.findById(id).orElseThrow(() -> new ResponseStatusException(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND, String.format("Invalid ride id %s", id)));
    }

    @PostMapping(value = "/ride", consumes = MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE, produces = MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE)
    public ThemeParkRide createRide(@Valid @RequestBody ThemeParkRide themeParkRide) {
        return themeParkRideRepository.save(themeParkRide);
    }
}

```

-   the `@RestController` annotation tells Spring Boot what type of component this is
-   for the `getRides` method we use the `@GetMapping` annotation to tell Spring Boot weâ€™re expecting a `GET` request at the specified path
-   the `getRide` method has a `@PathVariable` annotation so we can pass the ride id in the path `/ride/{id}`
-   the `createRide` method uses the `@RequestBody` annotation to automatically map the JSON request to the `ThemeParkRide` entity.
-   the `@Valid` annotation is included on the incoming `ThemeParkRide` entity to validate it according to any annotations on itâ€™s fields (e.g. `@NotEmpty`)

#### Application class

The final class we have to add to have a fully working (but untested) application will be `ThemeParkApplication`:

```
package com.tomgregory;

import com.tomgregory.entity.ThemeParkRide;
import com.tomgregory.repository.ThemeParkRideRepository;
import org.springframework.boot.CommandLineRunner;
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;

@SpringBootApplication
public class ThemeParkApplication  {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(ThemeParkApplication.class);
    }

    @Bean
    public CommandLineRunner sampleData(ThemeParkRideRepository repository) {
        return (args) -> {
            repository.save(new ThemeParkRide("Rollercoaster", "Train ride that speeds you along.", 5, 3));
            repository.save(new ThemeParkRide("Log flume", "Boat ride with plenty of splashes.", 3, 2));
            repository.save(new ThemeParkRide("Teacups", "Spinning ride in a giant tea-cup.", 2, 4));
        };
    }
}

```

-   the `@SpringBootApplication` annotation tells Spring Boot that this class is defining our main application
-   the `main` method means that when we run this class the application will start
-   the `sampleData` bean definition adds three default rides for us

## 2\. Trying out our Spring Boot application

Run the `ThemeParkApplication` class or `./gradlew bootRun` to start the application:

![](https://tomgregory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-29-1024x345.png)

Letâ€™s make some requests to the application. I recommend the [Postman tool](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) for easily making requests via a nice UI.

#### Get all rides

Letâ€™s call `GET` `/ride` to get all rides

![](https://tomgregory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-30.png)

We can see the three rides are returned as per the `sampleData` bean definition in `ThemeParkApplication`.

#### Create ride

Letâ€™s `POST` some JSON data to `/ride` to create a new ride:

```
{
"name":"Monorail",
"description":"Sedate ride that takes you around the park.",
"thrillFactor":2,
"vomitFactor":1
}
```

Weâ€™ll need to remember to also add a `Content-Type` header of `application/json`.

![](https://tomgregory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-31.png)

Thatâ€™s a `200` `OK` response. So far, so good.

#### Get ride

Letâ€™s `GET` the ride we just added calling `/ride/4`:

![](https://tomgregory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-32.png)

The _Monorail_ ride is returned as expected!

#### Adding a test

Itâ€™s great that everythingâ€™s working, but letâ€™s add an automated test to validate this functionality so our fingers donâ€™t get too tired. ![ðŸ¤ž](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/1f91e.svg)

What follows is an integration test class `ThemeParkApplicationIT` that should be added to `src/test/java`. Weâ€™ll use it to test interactions with the three APIs all the way through our application to the database.

```
package com.tomgregory;

import static org.springframework.test.web.servlet.result.MockMvcResultMatchers.status;

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.extension.ExtendWith;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.boot.test.autoconfigure.web.servlet.AutoConfigureMockMvc;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
import org.springframework.http.MediaType;
import org.springframework.test.context.junit.jupiter.SpringExtension;
import org.springframework.test.web.servlet.MockMvc;
import org.springframework.test.web.servlet.request.MockMvcRequestBuilders;

@ExtendWith( SpringExtension.class)
@SpringBootTest
@AutoConfigureMockMvc
public class ThemeParkApplicationIT {

    @Autowired
    private MockMvc mockMvc;

    @Test
    public void getsAllRides() throws Exception {
        mockMvc.perform(MockMvcRequestBuilders.get("/ride")
                .accept(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON))
                .andExpect(status().isOk())
                .andReturn();
    }

    @Test
    public void getsSingleRide() throws Exception {
        mockMvc.perform(MockMvcRequestBuilders.get("/ride/1")
                .accept(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON))
                .andExpect(status().isOk())
                .andReturn();
    }

    @Test
    public void returnsNotFoundForInvalidSingleRide() throws Exception {
        mockMvc.perform(MockMvcRequestBuilders.get("/ride/4")
                .accept(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON))
                .andExpect(status().isNotFound())
                .andReturn();
    }

    @Test
    public void addsNewRide() throws Exception {
        String newRide = "{\"name\":\"Monorail\",\"description\":\"Sedate travelling ride.\",\"thrillFactor\":2,\"vomitFactor\":1}";
        mockMvc.perform(MockMvcRequestBuilders.post("/ride")
                .contentType(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
                .content(newRide)
                .accept(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON))
                .andExpect(status().isOk())
                .andReturn();
    }
}
```

-   the 3 class level annotations are required so that Spring Boot initialises itself, creates the beans, and configures the `MockMvc` class
-   `MockMvc` can be used to make requests into our application. For example, in the first test weâ€™re making a `GET` request to `/ride` and expecting a `status().isOk()` response

Run the test by executing `./gradlew test`. Open up `build/reports/tests/test/index.html` to see your test report.

![](https://tomgregory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-33-1024x366.png)

Everythingâ€™s A-OK!

## 3\. Running Jenkins

The next stage is to automatically build our Spring Boot application on commit, or in other words to use _continuous integration_. This will ensure that our master branch is always in a good state, and anything that gets deployed into production is a working version of our application.

Weâ€™ll use the popular build tool **Jenkins** for this purpose, and will set it up to run as a Docker container on our local machine. For the following steps youâ€™ll need Docker, which you can get from the [Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

#### Bootstrapping Jenkins

A good devops philosophy is to define all infrastructure and configuration as code. So, weâ€™ll _bootstrap_ Jenkins to start up and configure whatever jobs we need automatically, with minimal manual setup required.

This concept has been discussed in detail in my [_How to bootstrap Jenkins for disaster recovery and accountability_](https://youtu.be/s7dw0ahriQY) YouTube video. Weâ€™ll build on top of the code example from the video, which can be found in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/tkgregory/jenkins-demo.git) and cloned like this:

```
git clone https://github.com/tkgregory/jenkins-demo.git
```

Make sure the Spring Boot application is stopped as Jenkins uses the same port. Then build and run Jenkins:

`./gradlew build docker dockerRun`

Navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) and youâ€™ll have an instance of Jenkins running:

![](https://tomgregory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-35-1024x344.png)

You can see we already have one job called _seed-job_ automatically available. This job is responsible for creating any other jobs that we need. Letâ€™s run it by clicking on the name and then clicking _Build Now_.

Once it finishes, go back to the Jenkins home page and youâ€™ll see that _seed-job_ has generated an additional _pipelineJob_ for us.

![](https://tomgregory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-36-1024x319.png)

Build that job and youâ€™ll see we have a successful pipeline execution, with a _Build_ and _Test_ stage:

![](https://tomgregory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-38-1024x599.png)

**Info:** a _pipeline_ in Jenkins is just a specific kind of job that can be split into different stages, as shown in the UI above

If you click on the blue circle to the left of _#1_ in _Build History_, you can see the console output:

![](https://tomgregory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-39-1024x570.png)

These two stages just print out some text for now. The point is that we can very quickly have a working instance of Jenkins available. In the next section, weâ€™ll add a new pipeline for our theme park application.

## 4\. Adding a Jenkins pipeline job to build the Spring Boot application

Letâ€™s modify the [jenkins-demo](https://github.com/tkgregory/jenkins-demo.git) project to include a new pipeline to build our Spring Boot application. The diagram below summarises the flow from when we initially run _seed-job_ to when our pipeline job will run against our theme park application.

![](https://www.lucidchart.com/publicSegments/view/b2666652-b54d-4e23-8e47-784278cfbd8f/image.png)

Once again, make the code changes yourself for the best learning experience. To do this youâ€™ll need to create and push two of your own repositories:

1.  **a repository for the Spring Boot theme park application** (everything created in sections 1 and 2 of this article). Once created, youâ€™ll need to substitute your own Git repository URL in the _createJobs.groovy_ code snippet below.
2.  **a repository for the Jenkins code**. This should be based on the [jenkins-demo](https://github.com/tkgregory/jenkins-demo.git) project (you can fork the project if you like). Once created, edit the _seedJob.xml_, replacing the existing Git repository on line 10 with your own e.g. `<url>https://github.com/<your-username>/jenkins-demo.git</url>`

If you donâ€™t want to create any repositories and instead prefer to use the ones Iâ€™ve made available for you, Iâ€™ll also explain how to do that below.

#### Creating a new job

Open up the _createJobs.groovy_ file, which is responsible for creating any jobs when _seed-job_ is run. Weâ€™ll add the following section which defines an additional pipeline job:

```
pipelineJob('theme-park-job') {
    definition {
        cpsScm {
            scm {
                git {
                    remote {
                        url 'https://github.com/tkgregory/spring-boot-api-example.git'
                    }
                    branch 'master'
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This definition uses the Jenkins Job DSL Plugin syntax to create a pipeline job from a _Jenkinsfile_ in the _[spring-boot-api-example](https://github.com/tkgregory/spring-boot-api-example.git)_ repository (or use your own if you prefer). A _Jenkinsfile_ is a pipeline definition that lives inside the repository of the project that it applies to.

**Info:** the Jenkins Job DSL plugin provides a mechanism to bootstrap Jenkins jobs. Without it, youâ€™d have to create the jobs from the UI.

Push the above change to your own repository, as Jenkins has to fetch the _createJobs.groovy_ file remotely.

If you donâ€™t want to set that up, you can modify _seedJob.xml_ and change the branch name on line 15 from _master_ to _theme-park-job_.

```
<branches>
  <hudson.plugins.git.BranchSpec>
<name>*/theme-park-job</name>
  </hudson.plugins.git.BranchSpec>
</branches>
```

This way it will fetch the updated _createJobs.groovy_ file from a branch Iâ€™ve made available just for you.

#### Adding a Jenkinsfile to _spring-boot-api-example_

Weâ€™ll create a _Jenkinsfile_ in the top level of the project with the following contents:

```
pipeline {
    agent any

    triggers {
        pollSCM '* * * * *'
    }
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh './gradlew assemble'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh './gradlew test'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This is a basic pipeline that checks for any changes to our code every minute, then runs two stages:

-   **Build** â€“ where we assemble the project
-   **Test** â€“ where we test the project

Push these changes to your own repository, or just rely on the [repository Iâ€™ve already added](https://github.com/tkgregory/spring-boot-api-example.git) with the required Jenkinsfile.

#### Running the new job

Stop the previous Jenkins instance by running `./gradlew dockerStop` then bring up a fresh one with:

`./gradlew build docker dockerRun`

First run the _seed-job_ again to create the new _theme-park-job_:

![](https://tomgregory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-40-1024x333.png)

Then click on the new job and hit _Build Now_:

![](https://tomgregory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-41-1024x526.png)

After some time you should have a successful build. Jenkins will highlight in green the two stages we defined, as well as the initial checkout.

## 5\. Final thoughts

Getting Jenkins running and building a Spring Boot project can be quite straightforward. Obviously in a proper setup you wonâ€™t run Jenkins on your local machine, as youâ€™ll need high availability and most likely access by other team members. If youâ€™re using AWS consider running Jenkins in an ECS or EKS cluster (see _[Deploy your own production-ready Jenkins in AWS ECS](https://tomgregory.com/deploy-jenkins-into-aws-ecs/)_).

In [part 2](https://tomgregory.com/building-a-spring-boot-application-in-docker-and-jenkins/) of this series weâ€™ll move our Spring Boot application into Docker, build the Docker image in Jenkins, and then push that to a remote repository.
